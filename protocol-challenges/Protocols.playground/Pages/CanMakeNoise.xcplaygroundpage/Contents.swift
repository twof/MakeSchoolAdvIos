/*:
 **Tasks**:
 1. Uncomment above line and make the code compile. This can be achieved by implementing the `CanMakeNoise` protocol in all the classes. Think about a noise each class could make and print it to the console using `print`.
 2. Iterate over `arrayOfNoiseMaker` and let each object make their noise
